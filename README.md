# odin-recipes

This is the HTML project that I will use what i learned about html and git to put together a website that has three simple recipes linked to from the main index page.
I learned how to put images into my website along with headers and paragraphs. I also got to practice using git commit to a repository with git commit messages to accompany my commits.
